# My version of the "Workoutfragment!"

##Problem
The objective of this activity was to design a 2 fragments, one is a fragment that will contain a list and another is a fragment that will contain the text for the workout. The significance of thie feature is that the codes in the fragments may be reused and reimplemented in different ways. For example, on a phone it may show just one fragment in an activity while on a larger device it may show 2 fragments at the same time without really changing the code inside each fragment.
